### Introduction

Hello! I'm a seasoned freelance web developer and computer engineer, passionate about crafting high-quality digital solutions that make a real impact. With expertise spanning advanced web development, I bring a complete skill set to every project—from designing user-friendly interfaces to handling rigorous testing and maintenance. My technical proficiency covers a wide array of modern technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vite, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Firebase, and SQL.

Whether I'm building from the ground up or collaborating within a team, my versatility shines through. I’m equally comfortable leading independent projects or integrating seamlessly into a larger development group to achieve shared goals.
